# Seacoast JavaScript Application
By Megan Nourse

## Overview
This is a single page application. It displays a table of Names and Widgets. It uses jQuery 3.6, jQuery UI 1.12, Bootstrap 5.1, and custom javascript to work. It was written in a single file as per request. Data is stored in localStorage, and can be reset to the intial seed values using the "Reset Data" button.

## Potential future updates
- Separate the scripts and style into their own files
- Add animation values to the changes
- Make the element embeddable in another page
